t_rise = Time taken to rise from 10% to 90%.

t_fall = Time taken to fall from 90% to 10%.

Edge Rate (trf): (t_rise + t_fall )/2.

High-to-Low propagation delay (tpHL): Time taken to fall from VOH to 50%.

Low-to-High propagation delay (tpLH): Time taken to rise from 50% to VOL.

Propagation Delay (tp): (tpHL + tpLH)/2.

Contamination Delay (tcd): Minimum time from the input crossing 50% to the output crossing 50%.

For 1.8V:

    10% of 1.8 = 0.18V
    90% of 1.8 = 1.62V
